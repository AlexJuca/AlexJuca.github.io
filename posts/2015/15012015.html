					<p>We all like movies, some more than others. This one day I was in the park in deep thought, wondering why there are so many 		movies depicting the end of the world, aliens attacking earth and taking over our planet and so forth and I came up with a chain of 	plausible theories. Firstly movies are a bloody good way of entertaining the mind and also entrain the mind. 

						First of all, when you're watching television or in this case a movie the higher brain regions (like the midbrain and the neo-cortex) are shut down, and most activity shifts to the lower brain regions (like the limbic system). The neurological processes that take place in these regions cannot accurately be called “cognitive.” The lower or reptile brain simply stands poised to react to the environment using deeply embedded “fight or flight” response programs. Moreover, these lower brain regions cannot distinguish reality from fabricated images (a job performed by the neo-cortex), so they react to television content as though it were real, releasing appropriate hormones and so on. Studies have proven that, in the long run, too much activity in the lower brain leads to atrophy in the higher brain regions.
					</p>

					<p>
						Simply put your brain is in a perfect position to learn new things in that state of mind and your subconcious mind will
						accept any information as real even though you know it's just a movie. Now what I have noticed is how hollywood repeats the same end of world and alien domination movies over and over again. This has been happening for a long time now. We could say that it's just a coincidence and there is nothing else to it than pure entertainment but what if it's not just entertainment? What if there is something more serious behind this? 

						My theory is that these movies are being made to entrain us subconciously by repeating the same stories over and over again.
						If you tell a story to the same person alot he or she is most likey to believe you even if he or she did not believe you the first 
						time.

					</p>

					<p>
						I remember the school I went to had this exercise where students would prepare for fires or explosions so we know how to react during emergencies. The school would repeat the exercise enough so that students know how to react when there is a fire or similiar kind of emergency. If there was a fire one day most kids would do exactly what they were taught because they were entrained to do so. Now the same thing could happen when you watched the same type of end of world movies. 

						If you have ever watched an end of world movie you must have seen a part where everyone reacts disorderly and fight for food in the store so they can survive or try and kill each other to get a car to escape something. Well your brain recorded all that and your likely to react just like the individuals in the movie than any other way because you have seen it so much that your mind does exactly what it was taught. You act disorderly and if necessary go beyond your moral boundaries by killing someone.

						We could say that in such a situation it would be normal to react in a disorderly manner because hey the world is "ending".
						What if we rewrote these movies and instead of people acting disorderly we have them acting cool and calm and helping one another?
						If this "end" came in real life how would we react after being entrained by the more positive movies? Science says we would be more likely to do what we already saw and thus stay calm and help one another.

						I truly believe movies are being used to program us to behave in certain ways and I am not the only one to observe these things.
						I suspect they are being created to prepare us for some future event that will occur and we will be defenceless.

						What do you think?
