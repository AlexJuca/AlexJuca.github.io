					<p>Three years ago, I made a decision. A decision that led me to this position on this chessboard called life.
            The decision was fueled by innocence and curiosity and a need for something new that would serve as the foundation
            for my life and career. I planned, but things ended up a bit different to what I thought could be possible. What choice did I make?
            What pill did I take?  </p>

          <p>
              I never finished University, I could barely say I started but three years ago I told myself I will
              know everything I need to think
              like a computer scientist and build great software. I worked hard, read the best books, did the best courses,
              and practiced every single day for no less than 4 hours a day. The journey on this path was not easy. I walked
              on metaphorical thorns and bled metaphorical blood. My health is like a pendelum on a table and that table is on
              a boat and that boat is being punched by mohamam Ali or rather the waves. And these waves make it difficult for me to
              keep focused on every aspect of my life be it the spiritual or emotional. I fought through the tough times
              and managed to be a founder of one of Angola's most promising startups, Beezond. It was a great adventure and learning experience
              being there and building a product called Cinyur for android even though it did not get launched to the general public.

          </p>

          <p> I left Beezond and started working on a new startup bringing with me all the lessons I had learnt from my past experience there.
            The startup I started alone during a phase where the waves were calm and easy. I was feeling good healthwise and
            was in a really creative state of mind and during that phase I managed to start on a new product called moments. Spewed out code
            for all our websites single handedly, did the designs, logo in just two weeks.
            That moment did not last and the waves started hitting harder than before,
            but I kept on going. </p>

            <p> On the 24 of October of 2015 I participated in what changed my life forever and taught me even more about running
              a startup. My startup was selected to be one of the startups to participate in Seedstars Luanda a competition organized
              by SeedsStars World and KiandaHub to find the most promising startups in Angola, my country of birth. I
               remember meeting with the ROCKSTARS
              of programming in Angola and observed their ways and manerisms so that I can learn from them.I vividly recall the day of the final competition I was radiating ebullience.
              I was suprised near the end that my startup got second place. I gave it my best and I was happy about it. I was happy that my work was appreciated
              and that the choice led me to a road I am happy to be on with it's difficulties and problems. Life has no pleasure if there is no problems.
              We feel good when we resolve issues and I understand and accept that life is like that. I am excited for what the future holds and nervous as well.
              I firmly believe that if I do learn from the mistakes the giants have made before me I will end up sucessful. I initially wrote this post to serve as a reference
              guide for me next year. I had a good year mostly because I learnt more than I expected, did what I thought was not possible years ago, inspired
              people to chase their dreams, started new relationships and ended bad ones. I am grateful for the little I have now. Until 2016!
