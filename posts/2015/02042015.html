                <h2>The startup/spaceflight vortex</h2>
                <p>It’s the day of the flight and you look at your fellow astronauts, each one with an anxious looking face that causes your heart to do some pretty amazing acrobatics inside your chest and your tummy feeling like Hiroshima after the equivalent of about 16 kilotons of TNT landed on it’s soil. You begin to make your way to the space shuttle’s entrance each step feeling like a thousand miles and your mind rehearsing everything you had learned throughout your years of intensive training. The sweat collecting in your palms like dew in the morning and than what feels like Godzilla crushing a building is really your team mate patting your shoulders which rips you out of the vortex of fear and into a dimension of calm. His smile and enthusiasm sending wonderful vibrations into every cell of your body and causing dopamine to explode inside your brain. Leaving you excited about the journey you are on.</p>

<h2>That’s how I feel working at Beezond</h2>
                <p>There are so many similarities between creating a startup and preparing for space flight. We research, plan, engineer, test and prepare to successfully launch and land a spaceship (product) that we hope might leave a crater on the world. As a co-founder of a startup I have to make good decisions for the good of the team and our product and I am happy to be with co-founders I can express myself with and get really awesome feedback. Recently we were selected by an organization called INAPEM to receive support for our startup and we are extremely happy with that.

Now we practically breath and eat our startup, constantly learning more about startups, business, software engineering ,development and implementing great ideas we learn from other startups into our own where we see the need and it’s being an incredible experience so far.

Building it in a country where startups are not common and hardly supported by the government makes things difficult. Adding the fact that the mobile and tech market here in Angola is really in it’s infancy makes things a bit harder depending on how you see it but that in itself can be viewed as an opportunity too.</p>

<h2>The land of uknowns</h2>
                <p>The spaceship you are on was sling shot into space like David’s stone into the air by a whopping amount of energy but here you don’t know where Goliath is. You look out the window as you make the transition out of the earths atmosphere into a land of unknowns. Your training prepared you for life outside earth but everything feels different to the simulation you experienced during training. It’s not quite the same.</p>

<p>That is how I feel right now. Our team is spending a huge amount of energy building our startup and planning for it’s success but we don’t know exactly where we are heading to, we have never taken this flight before and we don’t know where to land. So many things can happen on our journey to finds Goliaths head in this huge milky way made up of billions of stars but we are learning as we go. Collecting data on our journey and finding ways to improve ourselves and I tell you it is really an awesome experience.</p>

<p>I thank my team members for being a pillar throughout this experience. I would like to come back to finish this story when I make my way back to earth safely with my team members all with me but for now I am on a learning experience and just at the beginning of the exploration of this land of unknowns. We might fail or we might succeed. No one knows. But we are pushing hard knowing that humanity depends on us to come back alive and well.</p>

<p>I am Alexandre Juca, an astronaut and co-founder of Beezond this is my message I am broadcasting to the world, if you are out there and reading this I thank you, tell the world I will be back.</p>
